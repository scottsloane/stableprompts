StablePrompts is an LLM based prompt generator for StableDiffusion.

## Requirements

Currently StablePrompts requires the following:

- NodeJS with Yarn
- StableHordeAPI access and key
- Ollama

## Installation

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/scottsloane/stableprompts.git`
2. Install packages `yarn i`
3. Run with `node . (options)`

## Usage

At the prompt enter an idea/subject for an image you wish to generate. Press enter when done. After a short wait, 5 prompts will be displayed for you.

You can then render your image with the `.render last {i}` command where **i** is the number of the image you wish to render. Leave off **i** to render all of them.
